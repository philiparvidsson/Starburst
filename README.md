## About the Game

The game was developed as a school assignment over the course of four weeks, by five comp.sci. students. Everything is written from the ground up; physics, rendering, sound, particles are all developed as part of this project and no third party software components were used.

Using XNA was part of the assignment, although we did not utilize it further than as a wrapper for rendering. All game mechanics were implemented in C# by the development team.
